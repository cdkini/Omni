## Background
A lightweight, CLI-based version control system built in Java.  

# Classes and Data Structures
` Include here any class definitions. For each class list the instance variables  and static variables (if any). Include a brief description of each variable     and its purpose in the class. Your explanations in this section should be as concise as possible. Leave the full explanation to the following sections. You  may cut this section short if you find your document is too wordy.`

# Algorithms
` This is where you tell us how your code works. For each class, include a high-level description of the methods in that class. That is, do not include a line-by -line breakdown of your code, but something you would write in a javadoc comment above a method, including any edge cases you are accounting for. We have read the project spec too, so make sure you do not repeat or rephrase what is stated there. This should be a description of how your code accomplishes what is stated in the spec.`
