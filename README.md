### Intro
Omni is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. Taking heavy inspiration from Git, this project emphasizes performant, safe operations on your codebase to allow you and others to save snapshots of your repositories. Whether you aim to secure your local personal projects or keep tabs on more complex distributed codebases, Omni is all always keeping an eye out so you don't have to.

Akin to other popular distributed version-control systems, Omni allows for integral features used in the software development process, including:
- Committing
- Branching
- Merging
- Rebasing
- and more!

<i>Please note that the contents of this repository were designed and implemented solely for educational purposes. The Omni development team has no intentions of monetization or commercialization and exists solely to reinforce the value of open source software and its community.</i>


### Playground
To test out the language, visit the [official Omni playground](https://repl.it/@ChetanKini/OmniPlayground) as hosted on Repl.it! Please note that due to size and dependency restrictions, all software features may not be supported.

## Installation


### Dependencies
Omni was written on a 64-bit [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS OS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) using [Java 11.0.6](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/11-0-6-relnotes.html). The project uses no external dependencies so access to any version of Java 11 and bash to run `.sh` files should be all you need.
