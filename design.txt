Omni Design Document
---------------------------

Classes and Data Structures
---------------------------
Include here any class definitions. For each class list the instance variables and static variables (if any). Include a brief description of each variable and its purpose in the class. Your explanations in this section should be as concise as possible. Leave the full explanation to the following sections. You may cut this section short if you find your document is too wordy.

Algorithms
---------------------------
This is where you tell us how your code works. For each class, include a high-level description of the methods in that class. That is, do not include a line-by-line breakdown of your code, but something you would write in a javadoc comment above a method, including any edge cases you are accounting for. We have read the project spec too, so make sure you do not repeat or rephrase what is stated there. This should be a description of how your code accomplishes what is stated in the spec.

Persistence
---------------------------
Describe your strategy for ensuring that you donâ€™t lose the state of your program across multiple runs.


For each command, list the following:
  - Description
  - Runtime(s)
  - Failure Cases
  - Dangerous
  - Implementation
